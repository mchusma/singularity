# Singularity

## Installation

Run:
`npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

`npm start`

## Architecture
- Expo / React Native
- Redux - To store the state and set things up to be updated correctly
- Redux persist to store the content between sessions (in the asyncStorage)

## To Do
- Keep working to modularize things
- Figure out where/how the main "game logic" should live. JSON file? Something else?
